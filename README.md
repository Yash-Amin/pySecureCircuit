# pySecureCircuit

pySecureCircuit is a Python library that allows secure multiparty computation using Yao's garbled circuit technique. The library provides a way for parties to securely compute a function on their private inputs without revealing them to each other, using a combination of encryption, randomization, and computation over circuits.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use pySecureCircuit for the Millionaire's Problem for two parties.

Write your function logic in a python script.

```python
from pysecurecircuit.circuit import Circuit
from pysecurecircuit.server import Server


def main():
    # Create circuit with 2 party
    circuit = Circuit(name="Millionaires' Problem", num_parties=2)

    # Define input variable
    alice_wealth = circuit.newSecureInteger()
    bob_wealth = circuit.newSecureInteger()

    # Circuit logic
    alice_richer_than_bob = alice_wealth > bob_wealth

    # Assign input variables to alice and bob
    circuit.assign_to_party(party_idx=0, name="Wealth (Alice)", variable=alice_wealth)
    circuit.assign_to_party(party_idx=1, name="Wealth (Bob)", variable=bob_wealth)

    # Set circuit's output
    circuit.set_output(name="Alice richer than Bob", variable=alice_richer_than_bob)

    # Start server
    Server(circuit, "0.0.0.0", 5000).start()

main()
```

#### Server

To start server for the circuit creator run

```sh
python3 script.py --host HOST --port PORT
```

#### Client

For circuit evaluator, run the following command

```sh
python3 -m pysecurecircuit.client --client-id CLIENT_ID --host HOST --port PORT
```

Where `CLIENT_ID` is the identifier of the client that starts from 1, `HOST` is the IP address or hostname of the server, and `PORT` is the port number to connect to.
